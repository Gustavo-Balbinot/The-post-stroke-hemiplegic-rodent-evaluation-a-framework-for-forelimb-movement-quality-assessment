Create the following folders to add the Position and Angle data exported from SkillSpector
DATA IN
Position: C:\Hemiplegic Rodent DATA IN\Position
Angle: C:\Hemiplegic Rodent DATA IN\Angle
DATA OUT
C:\Hemiplegic Rodent DATA OUT
Open the main program in LabVIEW (file: Mice staircase kinematics - MAIN)
Input the Animal Number, Staircase step, and sampling frequency (FPS)
Input the Name of the Files to be saved for each Data and Graph output
Run the main program
Go to DATA OUT (C:\Hemiplegic Rodent DATA OUT) to visualize the output files
DATA output files will have 4 columns (1: Animal Number, 2: Step, 3: Variable Number, and 4: Output)
GRAPH outputs will have 1 waveform (from 0-100% of the reach) for each row
